## Age of Empires III Multiplayer Map Hack

The function for removing 'fog of war' is in [hack.h](./aoe3-map-hack-dll/hack.h)

Reusable things such as the dll injector and socket client / server used to talk to the injected dll are in [common](./aoe3-map-hack-common/)

Join a multiplayer game and toggle fog of war with:
```
fog-off
fog-on
```

Code has been thrown together quickly, do not judge :)

Enjoy
